# How to Download and Extract RNA-Seq Data from NCBI GEO Datasets

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps required to download RNA-Seq data from the NCBI GEO Datasets and extract compressed `.gz` files using Python via the Anaconda Prompt. The aim is to retrieve the raw counts data from a GEO accession ID and unzip the downloaded file for further analysis.

## Steps

### 1. Downloading RNA-Seq Data
- Navigate to the [NCBI GEO Datasets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds) page.
- Enter the GEO accession ID (e.g., **GSEXXXXX**) and search for the dataset.
- Select the first result from the search output and locate the desired file type at the bottom of the page.
- Download the file, typically available in a compressed format such as `.gz`, to your working directory.

### 2. Extracting the Downloaded File
- To unzip the downloaded `.gz` file, use the Anaconda Prompt.
- The directory where the file is located is set using the `cd` command.
- Python is used to run a simple script that extracts the compressed `.gz` file and saves the uncompressed data as a new file in the working directory.

### 3. Running Python via the Anaconda Prompt
- The Python interpreter is started from the Anaconda Prompt, and a Python script is used to handle the extraction process.
- The `.gz` file is opened, and its contents are copied into a new uncompressed file with the same name but without the `.gz` extension.

## Output
- After successfully running the commands, the uncompressed file (e.g., **GSEXXXXX_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv**) will be created in the working directory.
- The original compressed file remains unchanged, and the uncompressed version is now ready for use in downstream analysis, such as differential gene expression.

## Conclusion
By following this process, RNA-Seq data can be efficiently downloaded from NCBI GEO Datasets and extracted using Python in the Anaconda Prompt. This method ensures that large compressed files, commonly used in bioinformatics datasets, are handled smoothly and made ready for further analysis. The use of Python's `gzip` and `shutil` modules provides a simple and effective way to unzip `.gz` files without requiring external software.
