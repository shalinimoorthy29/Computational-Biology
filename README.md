# Welcome to the RNA-Seq Repository

This repository showcases various RNA-Seq analysis techniques using Bioconductor packages in R. 

Mini-projects I will be publishing include, but are not limited to:

- Differential gene expression analysis using `DESeq2`
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots to visualise sample clustering
- Heatmaps of gene expression data with gene symbol mapping
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and other advanced RNA-Seq analyses

Stay tuned for more!

## Tools Used:
- R packages: `DESeq2`, `pheatmap`, `ggplot2`, `biomaRt`, and other Bioconductor packages
- Python: For handling data extraction and file management

Feel free to explore and use the provided scripts for your own RNA-Seq analysis projects!
