# Welcome to the Sequencing-Data-Analysis Repository

This repository will showcase various sequencing data analysis techniques using R. 

I’ll be exploring a range of techniques commonly used in sequencing data analysis, including:

- **Differential Gene Expression Analysis**: I’ll identify genes with significant expression changes across conditions using DESeq2.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: I’ll visualise sample clustering to assess data quality and batch effects.
- **Heatmap Visualisations**: I’ll generate informative heatmaps to display gene expression patterns, complete with gene symbol mapping.
- **Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: I’ll discover enriched biological pathways and processes based on expression data.
- **Future Projects**: Additional techniques will include single-cell RNA-Seq analysis, pathway analysis, and more.

Stay tuned for ongoing updates!

## Packages and Tools Used:

- **BiocManager**: I’ll use BiocManager to manage Bioconductor package installations and dependencies, ensuring that required packages and libraries for single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq analyses are up-to-date and compatible.

- **clusterProfiler**: This will facilitate functional enrichment analysis, enabling me to explore Gene Ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways, and other biological functions in clusters of genes or cells. It’s especially useful for interpreting single-cell clustering results in terms of biological relevance.

- **Seurat**: A comprehensive toolkit for single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. I’ll use Seurat for data filtering, normalisation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Seurat also supports visualisation techniques like t-SNE and UMAP, making it ideal for end-to-end single-cell workflows.

Feel free to explore and adapt the scripts provided for your own RNA-Seq analysis projects!
