Download RNAseq data from NCBI GEO DataSets:

- Open URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds
- Enter GEO accession ID: GSEXXXXX and click search
- Select the first option on the search output
- Scroll to bottom of page to find the required file type to download 
  or alternatively if the option "Download RNA-Seq counts" is available, select this option to find all files available for download.
- All files will exist as a compressed zip file which will require extracting after download.
- Select file and download to working directory
- I prefer to perform extraction using anaconda prompt as its easy to use for several zip file types.
- I highly recommend having it installed via Anaconda Distribution

Lets say we have a file that needs unzipping: GSEXXXXX_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz

Here is a script to unzip the file via anaconda prompt:
- Open command prompt or anaconda prompt if available
- Set directory: 
  cd "C:\Users\Folder\Sub-Folder"
- Then type python

You should see an output like this:
Python 3.12.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Apr 15 2024, 18:20:11) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

- Then use the following code:

import gzip
import shutil

with gzip.open('GSEXXXXX_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz', 'rb') as f_in:
    # Open a new file to write the uncompressed data
    with open('GSEXXXXX_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv', 'wb') as f_out:
        # Copy the contents from the gzip file to the new file
        shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)


- Finally, type exit()

Summary
cd command changes the directory to your desired location.
python starts the Python interpreter.
The Python code opens the .gz file and writes the uncompressed data to a new file.
exit() exits the Python interpreter once the extraction is complete.
After running these commands, the uncompressed file GSEXXXXX_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv will be created in your directory.
